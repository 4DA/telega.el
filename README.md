# telega.el [![Join the chat at https://t.me/emacs_telega](etc/chat_emacs_telega.svg)](https://t.me/emacs_telega)

`telega.el` is full featured unofficial client for
[Telegram](https://telegram.org "Telegram") platform for [GNU
Emacs](https://gnu.org/emacs "GNU Emacs").

`telega.el` is actively developed, for this reason, some features are
not implemented, or they are present just as skeleton for future
implementation. However, the core parts are mature enough so that it
is possible to use `telega.el` for basic chat.

# Installation

Being in active development, `telega.el` is not ready to be
distributed on archives such as MELPA. At the moment, the only way to
use is from this git repositary. This involves few simple steps
described below.

`telega.el` is built on top of the official library provided by
Telegram [tdlib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib "tdlib"). Most of the
distributions do not package this libary, so it has to be build from
source.

## Dependences

   * `GNU Emacs` (at least 25.1 is required)
   * `GNU make`
   * `GNU gperf`
   * `CMake`

`make` is found in most of the modern machines. The other packages can
be download with the system package manager (such as `apt` for
Debian-based distributions, `dnf` for Fedora or `pacman` for
Arch-based).

### Building tdlib

[tdlib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib "tdlib") is the backend used
to communicate with the servers. It requires a large amount of memory
to be built.

To get the source:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/tdlib/td.git
```

Move into the folder with `cd td`

Prepare a folder for building the library:
```console
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../
```

Build the sources:
```console
$ make -jN
```

with `N` number of cores that should be used for the compilation (the optimal
value is the number of physical cores on the machine).

Finally, to install the library system-wide:
```console
$ sudo make install
```

### Building libtgvoip

VoIP support in `telega.el` is optional, if you don't need VoIP, just
ignore this section.

[libtgvoip](https://github.com/zevlg/libtgvoip "libtgvoip") is the
VoIP library for telegram clients.  This is the fork from
[original](https://github.com/grishka/libtgvoip) library with patches
needed by `telega.el`.

To get the source:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/zevlg/libtgvoip.git
```

Move into the folder with `cd libtgvoip`

Prepare a folder for building the library:
```console
$ autoreconf --force --install && ./configure && make
```

Install the library system-wide:
```console
$ sudo make install
```

## Building telega-server

Now that the `tdlib` library is set-up, it is time to install
`telega.el`. The first step consists in building `telega-server`,
which is a C interface to the `tdlib`.

To get the source:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el
```

Moving into the folder with `cd telega.el`, it is possible to build
the `telega-server` executable and move into the `$HOME/.telega` with:
```console
$ make && make test && make install
```

If you want VoIP support in `telega.el` and `libtgvoip` is installed,
then use this instead:
```console
$ make WITH_VOIP=t && make WITH_VOIP=t test && make WITH_VOIP=t install
```

This command does not require superuser privileges.

Start with `M-x telega RET` and follow instructions

## Installing telega.el

Now it is time to install `telega.el` on GNU Emacs. 

This can be done with `use-package`:

```elisp
(use-package telega
  :load-path  "~/telega.el"
  :commands (telega)
  :defer t)
```

Or with:
```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/telega.el")
(require 'telega)
```

The code should be put in the configuration file for Emacs, which
usually is `init.el`, or `emacs.el`.

## Fire up `telega.el`

`telega.el` can now be started with `M-x telega RET`. The first time
it ask for the phone number to login to the Telegram network.

# Enabling D-Bus notifications

`telega.el` ships with support for D-Bus notifications, but they are
disabled by default.  To enable notifications add next code to your
`init.el`:

```elisp
(setq telega-use-notifications t)
```

# Enabling emoji completions in chat buffer

Emoji completions with `:<EMOJI-NAME>:` syntax, uses nice
[company-mode](http://company-mode.github.io).  It provides
`telega-company-emoji` company backend.  So you need to add it to
`company-backends`, maybe along with other backends in
`telega-chat-mode-hook`, for example:

```elisp
(add-hook telega-chat-mode-hook (lambda ()
    (setq company-backends '(telega-company-emoji))
    (company-mode 1)))
```

# FAQ

**Q**: I got the error after `M-x telega RET`

```console

Status: telega-server: exited abnormally with code 127
/home/user/.telega/telega-server: error while loading shared libraries:
libtdjson.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

**A**: Add `/usr/local/lib` into library loading path using next:

```console
# echo "/usr/local/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/usr_local_lib.conf
# ldconfig
```

**Q**: I'm from Russia, does `telega.el` has proxy support?

**A**: Yes, use `telega-proxies` custom variable, for example:

```elisp
(setq telega-proxies
      (list
       '(:server "1.2.3.4" :port 8080 :enable :false
                 :type (:@type "proxyTypeSocks5"
                               :username "rkn" :password "jopa"))
       '(:server "2.3.4.5" :port 8088 :enable t
                 :type (:@type "proxyTypeSocks5"
                               :username "rkn" :password "jopa"))
       ))
```

**Q**: How to make telega automatically download media content inside messages?

**A**: Automatic media download is enabled by default.  To disable use:

```elisp
(telega-media-auto-download-mode -1)
```

Customization is done via `telega-auto-download` variable.

**Q**: There is some formatting issues when some unicode characters are used.  Is there way to fix it up?

**A**: Yes, partly.  If character has full width of multiple ordinary chars you can tweak `char-width-table`.  Add code like this to your init.el:

```elisp
(setq telega-symbol-unread "ðŸ„Œ")

(defun my-telega-load ()
  ;; ðŸ„Œ occupies two full chars, but (string-width "ðŸ„Œ") returns 1
  ;; so we install custom widths to `char-width-table'
  (telega-symbol-set-width telega-symbol-unread 2)

  ;; ... other code
  )

(add-hook 'telega-load-hook 'my-telega-load)
```

There is also `telega-symbol-widths` custom variable, you might want
to modify it.

**Q**: Is there erc-like chats tracking functionality?

**A**: Yes, set `telega-use-tracking` to non-nil.

Take into account that telega tracks only opened chats with enabled
notifications.
