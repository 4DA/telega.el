* Telega glossary

Before start, please read [[https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/getting-started#tdlib-glossary][TDLib glossary]]

=telega= tries to keep TDLib's terminology, however introduces some
new terms specific to =telega=.  All of them are used in the manual.

- Root Buffer a.k.a. rootbuf ::
  Buffer with list of chats, you see it just after {{{kbd(M-x telega RET)}}}.
  Most of the time rootbuf term is used in the manual.
  See [[#root-buffer][Root Buffer]]

- Chat Buffer a.k.a. chatbuf ::
  Buffer with chat contents.
  See [[#chat-buffer][Chat Buffer]]

- Button ::
  Ordinary Emacs Button (see =button.el=).  Some outlined area with
  text, that can be acted on.  Pressing {{{kbd(RET)}}} on the
  button, executes button action.  There are many buttons of different
  kind in =telega=

- Chat Button ::
  Button referring to some chat.  Action for such button is to open
  corresponding chatbuf.

  rootbuf lists the chat buttons, such as:
  #+begin_example
  {ðŸŽ—Saved Messages            }ðŸ“Œ  ðŸ“¹ Video (10s)               Friâœ“
  [Emacs | Emacs (english)     ]  @oldosfan: same                Fri
  ...
  #+end_example

- Chat Filter ::
  S-exp expression used to match chats.
  See [[#chat-filters][Chat Filters]] for the details.

- Active Chat Filter ::
  Chat filter applied to the chat list in rootbuf.

  Only chats matching active chat filter are displayed in rootbuf.
  Active chat filter is displayed above the chat list in rootbuf, such
  as:
  #+begin_example
  -/------------------------------(main)--------------------------------
  #+end_example

  ~(telega-filter-active)~ returns active chat filter.

  + User Option: ~telega-filter-default~
    {{{vardoc1(telega-filter-default)}}}

    Default value: {{{eval(telega-filter-default)}}}

- Custom Chat Filter ::
  Chat filter associated with a name.

  Custom chat filters are displayed as buttons above the chat list in
  the rootbuf, such as:
  #+begin_example
  [243:ðŸ“‘Main      4890]  [51:Groups       4677]  [27:Channels      210]  
  [53:Contacts         ]  [0:Important         ]  [3:ðŸ“‘Archive      670]  
  #+end_example

  Action for such buttons is to add corresponding chat filter to
  active chat filter.

  However, special (push) custom chat filter buttons exists.  Instead
  of adding chat filter into active chat filter, they substitutes
  active chat filter with custom chat filter. See
  ~telega-filter-custom-push-list~ below.

  + User Option: ~telega-filters-custom~
    {{{vardoc1(telega-filters-custom)}}}
  
  + User Option: ~telega-filter-custom-push-list~
    {{{vardoc1(telega-filter-custom-push-list)}}}

    Default value: {{{eval(telega-filter-custom-push-list)}}}

- Chat Sort Criteria ::
  List of symbols denoting how to sort chats.
  See [[#sorting-chats][Sorting Chats]]

- Active Sort Criteria a.k.a. active sorter ::
  Sort criteria applied to the chat list in rootbuf.

  By default, chats are sorted according to internal Telegram order
  (except for chats with custom order).

  In case active sorter is enabled, it is displayed above the chat
  list in rootbuf, such as:
  #+begin_example
  -\---------------------(unread-count join-date)-----------------------
  #+end_example

- Me user a.k.a. me ::
  User currently logged in, ~(telega-user-me)~ returns me.

  me means you, not me.

  Chat with me is also known as "Saved Messages".
